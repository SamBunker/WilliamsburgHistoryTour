A fire in 1936 destroyed much of the inside of the building but repairs were made and the theater continued its operation. With the coming of television, it closed permanently in the 1950s.</div><a href='https://goo.gl/maps/L96ADpMrdQuYuZMS7' target='_blank'><img src='./img/maps.png' alt='Google Maps Image' style='position:relative;left:50%;transform:translateX(-50%);margin-top:10px;height:100px;width:100px;'></a>"
